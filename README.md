# Java2hu
A java library for danmaku games, run using Gradle.

Until the All Star Remake is done, we will not provide help for building the code.
The project is not done enough for me to start working on ways to set it up.

Also, most assets like character sprites are not included in this repository, so
it's unlikely that it can be set up as is, anyways.
